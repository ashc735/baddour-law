                <h4>Injury & Wrongful Death</h4>
                <p>If you or a loved one has been seriously injured—or worse—because of someone else's negligence,
                    recklessness, or a defective product, you may have a legal claim.
                    Baddour Law helps clients pursue justice and compensation in cases involving wrongful death, car and
                    truck accidents, dangerous products, and more. We handle these matters in both State and Federal

                <h4>Estate Planning & Probate</h4>
                <p>Baddour Law helps individuals plan for the future and manage what happens to their property after
                    they pass away.
                    This includes creating wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives to ensure your
                    wishes are followed and your loved ones are protected.
                    After someone passes, we can guide families through the legal process of settling the estate—making
                    sure debts are paid and assets are properly distributed.
                    These services help avoid confusion, reduce family conflict, and make a difficult time a little
                    easier.</p>

                <h4>Trust & Estate Litigation</h4>
                <p>Trust and estate litigation involves resolving disputes over wills, trusts, and the distribution of a
                    loved one's estate.
                    These cases often arise when family members disagree about the validity of a will, how a trust is
                    being managed, or whether someone acted unfairly or unlawfully. Baddour Law can represent you in
                    court to protect your rights and ensure your loved one's wishes are honored.
                    Trust and estate litigation helps bring clarity and resolution to complex, often emotional family
                    matters.</p>
